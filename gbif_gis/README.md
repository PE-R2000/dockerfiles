# This image belongs to a larger project called Bioinformatics Docker Images Project (http://pegi3s.github.io/dockerfiles)
## (Please note that the original software licenses still apply)

This image facilitates the usage of [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) (Global Biodiversity Information Facility - an international network and research infrastructure funded by the worldâ€™s governments and aimed at providing anyone, anywhere, open access to data about all types of life on Earth) data to predict species distributions.

# Using the GBIF image in Linux

You should adapt and run the following command: `docker run --rm -v /your/data/dir:/data pegi3s/gbif_gis bash -c "/opt/run <species_name>"`

In this command, you should replace:
- `/your/data/dir` to point to the directory that contains the input files you want to analyze.
- `<species_name>` to the actual name of the species.

For instance, if the selected species is `Solanum acaule*`, you should run: `docker run --rm -v /your/data/dir:/data pegi3s/gbif_gis bash -c "/opt/run Solanum acaule*"`

### *Note 1*
The previous command generates three files:
- `data.csv`:  a coordinates file showing the geographic coordinates of where the species was recorded.
- `statistics`: a results file containing some statistics on the species presence points.
- `Rplots-crop.pdf`:  a PDF file showing the presence and predicted distribution of the species (probabilities are given as color codes). The prediction model used is the [Bioclim](https://support.bccvl.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000083201-bioclim) model.

### *Note 2*
A folder named `wc2-5` containing data on 19 abiotic variables from [WorldClim](https://www.worldclim.org/) will be created, if not present.

# Using the GBIF image in Windows

Please note that data must be under the same drive than the Docker Toolbox installation (usually `C:`) and in a folder with write permissions (e.g. `C:/Users/User_name/`).

You should adapt and run the following command: `docker run --rm -v "/c/Users/User_name/dir/":/data pegi3s/gbif_gis bash -c "/opt/run <species_name>"`
