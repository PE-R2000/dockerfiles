This image facilitates the usage of [Splign/Compart](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/splign/splign.cgi), a utility for computing cDNA-to-Genomic, or spliced sequence alignments. More specifically, this image provides a script that executes the Splign/Compart pipeline as implemented in our [SEDA tool](https://www.sing-group.org/seda/manual/operations.html#splign-compart-pipeline).

Section 3.6 of [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2020.3040383) about SEDA describes the pipeline, which requires a reference nucleotide CDS to be available from a closely related species. This pipeline receives as input two FASTA files: a target FASTA (tipically a genome) used as subject and another one (tipically a CDS) used as query, and performs the following steps:
1. Create BLAST databases for both the genome and the CDS.
2. Run the `mklds` option of Splign (`splign --mklds`) on the working directory to create an LDS index that Splign will use to access the FASTA sequences.
3. Run Compart to produce the preliminary cDNA-to-genomic alignments (i.e. the compartments).
4. Run the `ldsdir` option of Splign (`splign --ldsdir`) to obtain the annotations using the obtained compartments as input.
5. Convert the ldsdir output annotations (`output.tsv`) into four BED files (one for each one of the four possible combinations depending on the relationships between the query/subject start/end coordinates of each annotation). There are four possible cases in the `output.tsv`:
    - Case 1: query start (col. 6) < query end (col. 7) and subject start (col. 8) < subject end (9): the annotations musts be read from beginning to end.
    - Case 2: query start (col. 6) < query end (col. 7) e subject start (col. 8) > subject end (9): the annotations musts be read from beginning to end and obtain the reverse-complement of the corresponding sequences.
    - Case 3: query start (col. 6) > query end (col. 7) e subject start (col. 8) < subject end (9): the annotations musts be read from end to beginning and obtain reverse-complement of the corresponding sequences
    - Case 4: query start (col. 6) > query end (col. 7) e subject start (col. 8) > subject end (9): the annotations musts be read from end to beginning.
6. Extract the regions in the BED files from the genome FASTA file to produce the four FASTA file with the annotations using bedtools. Then, calculate the reverse-complement of the sequences when needed (cases 2 and 3) and merge the four files into a single file.
7. If the concatenate exons option is selected, the adjacent exons are concatenated in the output FASTA file. Using this option, if an annotation is obtained for every exon of a given gene then the resulting sequence will be the complete CDS.

# Using Splign/Compart image in Linux

You should adapt and run the following command: `docker run --rm -v /your/data/dir:/data pegi3s/splign-compart splign-compart-pipeline /data/<nucleotide_subject> /data/<query_nucleotide_CDS> /data/<output> [--concat-exons]`

In this command, you should replace:
- `/your/data/dir` to point to the directory that contains the input files you want to analyze.
- `<nucleotide_subject>` to the name of the FASTA file for the target FASTA.
- `<query_nucleotide_CDS>` to the name of the FASTA file for the CDS query.
- `<output>` to the name of the output FASTA file.

Note that the `--concat-exons`parameter is optional. Type `docker run --rm pegi3s/splign-compart splign-compart-pipeline --help` for more details.

# Test data

To test this pipeline, it is possible to use [this test data](http://evolution6.i3s.up.pt/static/pegi3s/dockerfiles/splign-compart/test-data-splign-compart.zip) to apply the protocol described in [this page of Splign/Compart](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/splign/splign.cgi?textpage=documentation). This test data comes from [this use case](https://www.sing-group.org/BDBM/usecases.html#uc3) of our BDBM sofware. The `dsim-all-chromosome-r2.02.fasta` file is the subject genome (i.e. the target FASTA) and the `dmel-sod.fasta` is the CDS query.

After downloading and unzipping the test data, you should simply run (remember to change the `/your/data/dir` path):

```bash
docker run --rm -v /your/data/dir:/data pegi3s/splign-compart splign-compart-pipeline /data/dsim-all-chromosome-r2.02.fasta /data/dmel-sod.fasta /data/output.fasta
```

# Using Splign/Compart image in Windows

Please note that data must be under the same drive than the Docker Toolbox installation (usually `C:`) and in a folder with write permissions (e.g. `C:/Users/User_name/`).

You should adapt and run the following command: `docker run --rm -v "/c/Users/User_name/dir/":/data pegi3s/splign-compart splign-compart-pipeline /data/<nucleotide_subject> /data/<query_nucleotide_CDS> /data/<output> [--concat-exons]`

# Debugging

In case you need to keep the intermediate, temporary files generated during the pipeline execution, just add `-v /tmp:/tmp -e KEEP_TEMPORARY_DIR=TRUE` to the `docker run` command. The intermediate files will appear at `/tmp/splign-compart-pipeline.*`.

# Changelog

The `latest` tag contains always the most recent version.

## [1.2.0] - 26/05/2021
- Fixes the protocol to properly retrieve the FASTA sequences from the Splign/Compart annotations. We were creating a *bidirectional genome* (the original genome plus its reverse-complement) but we realized that Splign/Compart is able to anotate in both strands and therefore such *bidirectional genome* is no longer needed. After removing this, the way that the FASTA sequences are extracted from the annotations varies depending on the query/subject start/end coordinates.
- Remove the `--with-coordinates` flag. Now, all output sequences have the coordinates in their headers.

## [1.1.1] - 10/05/2021
- Add support for keeping temporary files.

## [1.1.0] - 12/04/2021
- Add the `--with-coordinates` flag.

## [1.0.0] - 15/02/2021
- Initial version.
