# Phenotypic Evolution Group Docker files

This repository contains Docker files for the images maintained by the [Phenotypic Evolution Group](http://www.i3s.up.pt/research-groups/neurobiology-and-neurologic-disorders/phenotypic-evolution) at the [Institute for Molecular and Cell Biology](https://www.ibmc.up.pt/) / [Instituto de Investigação e Inovação em Saúde da Universidade do Porto](https://www.i3s.up.pt/). All images are available through our [Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/u/pegi3s/).

In addition, this repository also contains tutorials to serve as guidance on the usage of existing Docker images (e. g. Trinity for RNA-Seq).
