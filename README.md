# Phenotypic Evolution Group Docker files

This repository contains Docker files for the images maintained by the [Phenotypic Evolution Group](http://www.i3s.up.pt/research-groups/neurobiology-and-neurologic-disorders/phenotypic-evolution) at the [Institute for Molecular and Cell Biology](https://www.ibmc.up.pt/) / [Instituto de Investigação e Inovação em Saúde da Universidade do Porto](https://www.i3s.up.pt/). All images are available through our [Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/u/pegi3s/). In order to visualize the Dockerfile of an image just add "Dockerfile" to the end of the Docker image URL.

In addition, this repository also contains tutorials to serve as guidance on the usage of existing Docker images (e. g. Trinity for RNA-Seq).
