This image facilitates the usage of [DnaSP v6](http://www.ub.edu/dnasp/), a software package for the analysis of DNA polymorphisms using data from a single locus (a multiple sequence aligned -MSA data), or from several loci (a Multiple-MSA data, such as formats generated by some assembler RAD-seq software).

# Using the DnaSP v6 image in Linux

Please note that the following instructions must be executed in Linux environments only.

You should adapt and run the following command: `docker run -it --rm --env="DISPLAY" --volume="${XAUTHORITY:-${HOME}/.Xauthority}:/root/.Xauthority:ro" --volume="/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:ro" -v=/your/data/dir:/data --hostname="$(hostname)" pegi3s/dnasp-v6 wine "/wineuser/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/DnaSP v6/DnaSP6.exe"`

If the above command fails, try running `xhost +` first. In this command, you should replace:
- `/your/data/dir` to point to the directory that you want to have available at `DnaSP v6`. 

Running this command opens the [DnaSP v6](http://www.ub.edu/dnasp/) Graphical User Interface. Your data directory will be available through the file browser at `/data`. Please, note that you must give write permissions to other users in this directory in order to allow DnaSP v6 write output files in it (e.g. `sudo chmod o+w /your/data/dir`).

# Building the Docker image

DnaSP v6 is a Windows application and it requires wine to run in a Linux-based Docker image. See the [DOCKER-BUILD.md](DOCKER-BUILD.md) file.
