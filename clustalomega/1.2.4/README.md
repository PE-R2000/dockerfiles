# Using the Clustal Omega image
You should adapt and run the following command: `docker run --rm -v /your/data/dir:/data pegi3s/clustalomega -i /data/sequences.fasta -o /data/sequences_aligned.fasta`

In this command, you should replace:
- `/your/data/dir` to point to the directory that contains the FASTA file you want to align.
- `sequences.fasta` to the actual name of your FASTA file.
- `sequences_aligned.fasta` to the actual name of your aligned FASTA file.

To see the Clustal Omega help, just run `docker run --rm pegi3s/clustalomega --help`.

# Test data
To test the previous command, you can copy and paste the following sample data into the `sequences.fasta` file:
```
>Sequence1
AAAAAAAATTTTTTTT
>Sequence2
AAAAAATTTTTT
>Sequence3
AAAATTTT
```

# Using the Clustal Omega image in Windows

Please, note that data must be under in the same drive than the Docker Toolbox installation (usually `C:`) and in a folder with write permisions (e.g. `C:/Users/User_name/`).

You should adapt and run the following command: `docker run --rm -v "/c/Users/User_name/dir/":/data pegi3s/clustalomega -i /data/sequences.fasta -o /data/sequences_aligned.fasta`
